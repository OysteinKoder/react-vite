- In this folder you put all the pages that you can get to from the landing page
- If a page is not linked to from the landing page, it should not be in this folder

- if a page has its own files, then you create a new folder for that page and put the files there.
- if that page has sub-pages, then you add those pages in the new folder.
- If those pages has their own files, then you create a new folder for that page

- This creates a tree structure of folders and files where the stem is the landing page, and new pages stick out like branches.
- This is a good way to organize your files because it is easy to find the files you need, and it is easy to see how the pages are connected.

- open up the productsPage folder and navigate around to see how the files and folders are organized

- There are different ways of organizing your files, but this is a good way to start.

- As long as you follow a logical pattern and your files and folders have good names it will be easy to find the files you need.
