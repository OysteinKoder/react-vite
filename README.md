# How to use this repo to learn react

- Each lesson will have its own branch, so branch "lesson-1" will be the first lesson, the branch "lesson-2" will be the second one.

- I recommend you do these in order, but hey. Im not from the code police

- In each lesson there is a task.txt file in the src folder, read this and do what it says.

- if you spot a ReadMe then read it! Its mandatory , it contains valuable information and explains conventions you should follow.

- Good luck! Happy learning

- Please give this repo a star.
